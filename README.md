# eXactter

**Precise settings, flawless style.**

### What is eXactter for? 

I'm creating eXactter because Prettier doesn't have the settings I need for code formatting. And I also want to have flexible settings for Vue's cascading styles, so that all code is written in the same style.

### Near-term goals:

- [ ] Make formatting for <style> in Vue
- [ ] Do formatting for TS, JS, Vue
- [ ] Make formatting flexible
